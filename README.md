# Tuango-Targeting-Mobile-App-Messages

## Project Description
This project entailed a detailed analysis and modeling for Tuango, a "deal-of-the-day" website in China akin to Groupon, with an aim to optimize their marketing efforts through mobile app push notifications. The key tasks included evaluating the true marginal cost of message pushes, constructing targeting models, conducting profitability analysis, and committing the code and results to GitHub.

## Technology Stack
- **Data Handling and Scripting**: Python
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyRSM
- **Data Storage**: Utilization of Parquet files for efficient data reading and storage
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Key Accomplishments

### Data Preprocessing and Preliminary Analysis
- **Data Processing**: Calculated response rates to push messages and average sessions purchased from the Tuango dataset.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Studied user purchase behavior to gauge the reception of push messages.

### Building Targeting Models
- **Regression Analysis**: Employed logistic and linear regression models to analyze factors affecting purchase responses and order sizes.
- **Variable Importance**: Ranked and evaluated the impact of key variables using permutation importance techniques.

### Profitability Analysis
- **Break-even Analysis**: Determined the breakeven response rate for push messages and based marketing strategies on these findings.
- **Profit Comparison**: Evaluated the profitability of targeting all customers versus those identified by predictive models.
- **ROI Visualization**: Displayed profitability and marketing ROI under various strategies using visual charts.

### Automation and Code Management
- **Code Reproducibility**: Ensured code reproducibility and managed version control using GitHub workflows.
- **Documentation**: Organized the entire analysis process and results in a Jupyter notebook and committed it to GitHub.

## Key Outcomes
- **Efficient Data Management**: Established a robust workflow from data processing to model analysis, improving data accessibility and preparation for analysis.
- **Enhanced Analytical Capabilities**: Delivered data-driven insights to Tuango, aiding in a better understanding of customer behaviors and preferences.
- **Automation and Scalability**: Implemented automated processes for efficient data handling and analysis, providing scalable solutions for future data needs and ensuring adaptability to evolving business demands.
